This is an implementation of stochastic progressive photon mapping via stochastic hashing and multiple threaded bounding volume hierarchy using GLSL. 

The code should run fine on multiple platforms and multiple GPUs, but I do not guarantee the compatibility. Please refer to the talk slides at Tokyo Demo Fest 2015 on my web page for some technical details.

I do not guarantee the correctness of any techniques in this implementation. I however would appreciate if you could let me know if you found any bugs. Please also do let me know if you extended this code for something more useful :->

< Known issues >
- It does not run correctly on Mac with NVIDIA/AMD GPUs (confirmed to run fine on Intel GPUs).
